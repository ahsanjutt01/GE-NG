                <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
                <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you
                    agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
                    particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web
                    application
                    can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information
                    about
                    your preferences.</p>

                <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about
                    web
                    page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
                    information
                    for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.</p>

                <p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you
                    find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any
                    information
                    about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline
                    cookies.
                    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
                    decline
                    cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
