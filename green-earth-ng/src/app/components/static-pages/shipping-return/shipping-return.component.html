                <h2>Shipping</h2>
                <p>All of our stock is delivered via Royal Mail and we aim to have items that are purchased via the
                    store before 4pm (UK time) Monday to Friday are sent out for delivery the same day.</p>

                <p>Any items purchased on the store after 4pm are sent out for delivery on the next working day.</p>

                <p>We endeavor to dispatch all orders placed before this time on the same day (Monday to Friday) however
                    due to the amount of orders placed (especially during holidays, events and weekends) this may not
                    always be possible.</p>

                <p>If you spend over £20 on the store, you are eligible for free first class delivery. You will be
                    provided with a tracking code so you can track the location of your package whilst in transit. Most
                    First Class delivery packages are delivered the next day, however depending on the volume of
                    packages the Royal Mail are delivering at the time this may affect delivery time.</p>
